<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>The emergence of various new applications, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT), Machine-to-Machine (M2M), and cloud/edge computing, has posed significant challenges for the efficient and effective operation of wireless communication and networking systems. At the forefront of these challenges is the adaptive, automated and autonomous optimization of multiple heterogeneous system entities that can learn, match and evolve with the system dynamics, while only observing limited information about the environment. Technically, this falls into the category of sequential decision making under uncertainty, which has motivated the adoption of online learning algorithms in the design and optimization of wireless systems. In this tutorial, we will discuss the basics of online learning theory and algorithms, with a special focus on their applications to wireless communications. We will explain state of the art learning methods that results in optimal interactions between the agents. We will also explain how to efficiently design learning algorithms, quantify their performance and characterize the interactions between the agents using these algorithms. Then, we will apply these methods to several exemplary problems in wireless communication and networking scenarios, including mobility management, coverage optimization, content caching, multi-user multi-channel communication, and cross-layer learning.</p>
