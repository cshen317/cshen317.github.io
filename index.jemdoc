I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of University of Virginia. I am also a member of the UVA [https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab Link Lab]. I got my B.S. and M.S. from Tsinghua University, and Ph.D. from UCLA. I received the NSF CAREER award in 2022.

My research interests span a number of interdisciplinary topics in AI/ML and its engineering applications. Some of my current research topics are:
- In-context learning and Transformers
- Reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandits
- Distributed and decentralized learning
- AI/ML for wireless
