I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of University of Virginia. I am also a member of the UVA [https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab Link Lab]. I got my B.S. and M.S. from Tsinghua University, and Ph.D. from UCLA. I received the NSF CAREER award in 2022.

My research interests span a number of interdisciplinary topics in machine learning, wireless communications, and networking. Some of my current research topics are:
- In-context learning and Transformers
- Distributed and decentralized learning
- Multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning, and their engineering applications
- Wireless communications and networking
